This is a machine learning template created and inspired on the book of Abhishek Thakur (https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/approachingalmost) on Approaching (Almost) Any Machine Learning Progress. You can find more information on the book or is github page.

The project implemented uses Titanic Dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) and is classification problem, however you can use it for regression problems too, is just made the necessary changes.

There is still most improvmens to made namely to deal:

- feature enginnering
- feature selection
- hyperparameter otimization
